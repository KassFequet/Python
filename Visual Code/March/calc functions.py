# Define required libraries.



# Define program constants.



# Define program functions.

# Long or complex calculations of a single value can be placed in a function.
# The resulting value calculated in the function is returned to the program.

# If any variables are required, they must be passed in as parameters.
# In this example, i will need the Number Grade.
