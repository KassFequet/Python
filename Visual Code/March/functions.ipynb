    "GitHub Copilot: The `Sum` function calculates the sum of all numbers up to and including the given value. Here's how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Function Definition**:\n",
    "   The function `Sum` is defined to take one parameter, `Number`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Range and Sum**:\n",
    "   The `range(1, Number + 1)` function generates a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to and including `Number`. The `sum` function then calculates the sum of this sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Return Value**:\n",
    "   The calculated sum is stored in the variable `total_sum`, which is then returned by the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the complete implementation of the `Sum` function:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def Sum(Number):\n",
    "    # Calculate the sum of all numbers up to and including the given value.\n",
    "    total_sum = sum(range(1, Number + 1))\n",
    "    return total_sum\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "To see how this function works, you can call it with a specific number and print the result:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example usage of the Sum function\n",
    "Number = 10\n",
    "result = Sum(Number)\n",
    "print(f\"The sum of all numbers from 1 to {Number} is {result}.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "- If `Number` is 10, `range(1, 11)` generates the sequence `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`.\n",
    "- The `sum` function calculates the sum of this sequence, which is `55`.\n",
    "- The function returns `55`, and it is printed as the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "This function is efficient and leverages Python's built-in functions to perform the calculation concisely.\n",
    "\n",
    "KassFequet: why is there plus 1\n",
    "\n",
    "GitHub Copilot: The `+1` in the `range` function is used to include the upper limit in the range. By default, the `range` function in Python generates numbers starting from the first argument up to, but not including, the second argument. Therefore, to include the upper limit, you need to add 1 to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the `Sum` function with an explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def Sum(Number):\n",
    "    # Calculate the sum of all numbers up to and including the given value.\n",
    "    total_sum = sum(range(1, Number + 1))\n",
    "    return total_sum\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "- `range(1, Number + 1)` generates a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to and including `Number`.\n",
    "  - For example, if `Number` is 10, `range(1, 11)` generates the sequence `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`.\n",
    "- The `sum` function calculates the sum of this sequence.\n",
    "  - For the sequence `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`, the sum is `55`.\n",
    "- The function returns the calculated sum.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "To see how this function works, you can call it with a specific number and print the result:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example usage of the Sum function\n",
    "Number = 10\n",
    "result = Sum(Number)\n",
    "print(f\"The sum of all numbers from 1 to {Number} is {result}.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will output:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "The sum of all numbers from 1 to 10 is 55.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `+1` ensures that the upper limit (`Number`) is included in the range, making the function calculate the sum correctly.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Convert the Purchase Date**:\n",
    "   The `purchase_date` string is converted to a `datetime` object using `datetime.strptime`.\n",

    "purchase_date = \"2022-02-14\"\n",
    "print(PaymentDate(purchase_date))  # Output: 2022-03-01\n",

    "```\n",

    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the day of the month is 25 or greater, an extra month is added to the payment date.\n",
    "- If the month is December, the year is incremented, and the month is set to January or February accordingly.\n",
    "- Otherwise, the month is incremented by one or two months based on the day of the month.\n",
    "\n",
    "This logic ensures that the payment date is correctly calculated based on the given rules."
